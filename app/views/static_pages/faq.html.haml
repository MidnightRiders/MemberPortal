          The Member Portal uses SSL to connect with your browser, which means the information you share with us is securely
          encrypted. In addition,
          %em we do not store any of your financial information on our servers.
          Instead, your information is passed on to
          = succeed ',' do
            = link_to 'Stripe', 'https://stripe.com', target: '_blank'
          a secure payment provider that manages credit cards and hands us a token by which to connect your account to their
          data. The only retrievable information Stripe maintains is the last four digits and expiration of your card, for
          your own reference, and tokens by which we can securely make charges. You will receive a receipt from us and from
          Stripe for every transaction.
