<%=@user.first_name%>,

Congratulations! You now have access to the new Midnight Riders Members-only site. Check it out at the link below.

There, you'll be able to manage your account information, submit your RevGuess and Man of the Match votes every week, and participate in the new Pick 'Em game with other Riders.

In the future, we plan for you to be able to manage a Riders Membership through PayPal, with the option for recurring yearly payments.

To get started, go to the link below and log in with the username <%=@user.username%>. Your temporary password is <%=@temp_pass%>. Be sure to change this right away. You can change your username, too, if you'd like, by clicking the "My Account" button in the upper right once you're logged in.

Get started now: [ <%= root_url %> ]

<%- if @user.role? 'family' %>
You are registered as having a family membership. Currently, the primary accountholder is the only one with Member Portal access. In the near future, we will be adding sub-account functionality so that your whole family may (if you choose) log in and participate in games, etc. Stay tuned.
<%- end %>

See you in the parking lots!
