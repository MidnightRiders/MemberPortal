# Midnight Riders Member Portal

The Midnight Riders Member Portal is a membership database for current Riders. It allows Riders
to update and manage their information, and play the games that used to be housed elsewhere, attached
to their Rider identity. In development, there's PayPal integration so that Riders can renew memberships
and this database can be used as the Database of Record for riders information and communications,
instead of Google Drive.
